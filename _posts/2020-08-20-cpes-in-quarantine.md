# Info on Professional CPEs
Professional certificates such as [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) require CPEs (Continuing Professional Education). Typically your employer will help you obtain fufill some of these requirements by sending you to trainings, conferences, and encourage professional development. But at the end of the day - it is a **personal responsibility** to complete this requirement in order to keep your certification. 

I will focus on CISSP development as this is the certification I have and I definitely recommend it if you want to get a job/career in 
- IT Professional
- Governance/Risk/Compliance
- Software Development
- Professional Hacker (Look for title such as Penetration Testing Engineer)

Even if you aren't 100% focused on security in your job, this certificate is definitely a differentiator in the field. *Warning:* you may become the security point of contact for your team. 

# CISSP CPE requirements list

The CISSP certificate requires you to obtain 120 CPEs in 3 years. If you do some simple math that is 40 per year. 1 CPE is more or less translated into 1 hour of professional development (emphasis on security). Here is the list of CPEs for CISSP. [Reference - Copy of CISSP Handbook](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/CPE/CPE---Handbook.ashx)

## Word to the Wise

Just remember - that all these CPEs may include an audit. So also pay attention to the documentation required per the website. I haven't been audited but I always make sure to due diligence to make sure I can attest to any of the work above while submitting my CPEs.

# Quarantine / CPEs

So what do you do when everyone is stuck at home and you are no longer being sent to conferences and able to work on the in-person related work as before?
As you can probably tell from skimming above - there is really no requirement to be in-person for any of these CPE requirements. However - conferences/trainings are getting canceled and employers budget is getting moved to cover other expenses. Below are some good ways to get CPEs while in quarantine.

## Security Podcasts

This is a big one for me. There are plenty free content online that cover security related material. What I love about podcasts is you can easy multi-task when listening to a podcast versus almost any other training. My favorite quarantine activity is to put on one of these podcasts and do the dishes or go for a walk. Then I am feeling both productive and listening to some really interesting content - AND I am getting CPEs for it.

Big Thanks to [@AveMaxima](https://twitter.com/AveMaxima) and [@MrThomasRayner](https://twitter.com/MrThomasRayner) for opening me up to this idea.

[![Twitter Podcast post](/assets/img/cpe-image1.png)](https://twitter.com/AveMaxima/status/1292434451658678272)

My personal recommendation for security related podcasts are:
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) - created by Jack Rhysider. 
    - My favorite episode set to get you hooked is XBox Underground [Part 1](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/45/) and [Part 2](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/46/). They are so good that I guarantine you will be thanking me later for the introduction (if you haven't heard them already)
- [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) - host Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte. Steve is a subject matter expert in security and Leo is a long time technology TV/Radio personality (I remember watching Leo on TechTV back in the day.) Really good topics and conversations here. Add this one to your podcast list.

## Youtube

Who knew I would get CPEs while being asked to like/subscribe to content creators videos. This was surprise number 2 for me. However this opens up just a huge list of free trainings including alot of great conference material that has gone virtual and free.

Here is one that will keep you busy - Defcon 20 Safe Mode - Defcon material has gone virtual this year and you can watch it online on youtube while collecting your CPEs.
- [Defcon 20 - Safe Mode - Main Stage Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLe-xW-Ws4c&list=PL9fPq3eQfaaBk9DFnyJRpxPi8Lz1n7cFv)

Checkout the Defcon website for more details:

## Virtual Conferences

Similar to the last recommendation - a lot of the conferences that usually cost thousands of dollars to attend have gone free this year. This is great news - however this means you have to sign up early as some have a virtual capacity and some will not post content after the show (unlike our friends at defcon above).

Some that I plan to attend:
- [Microsoft Ignite 2020 - 48hr virtual conference](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) - But wait - this is not a security conference. That is true! But remember if there are topics that are for a security discipline such as Business Continuiity Disaster Recovery (BCDR), Authentication/Authorization, Security Engineering, etc. these learnings can be part of Group A (otherwise non-security learning can still be part of Group B)
- [BSides Seattle 2020](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/) - This is a good opportuntiy as traditionally BSide security conferences are the content that barely miss approval or miss timing for DefCon and Blackhat. Presenters are always terrific and it is one of my favorite conferences I look forward to all year. Bsides founder is [@nerd_monkey](https://twitter.com/nerd_monkey) and he is very passionate about making it a great experience for all people interested in security topics. There are also other localized b-sides conferences - which could also be virtual this year. Win-win in my opinion.

## In Closing
Hopefully this post sparked your brain for some new ideas on how to get CPEs both in quarantine but also in some ways that boost your overall continued education. Find me on twitter if you think I missed anything that would be helpful for folks in their CPE journey!
