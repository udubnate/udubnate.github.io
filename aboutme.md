My name Nate Bruneau. I am an DevOps/Security/SRE/Software Developer @Microsoft. My posts and opinions are my own and not affliated with my employer.

- I love to learn and one of the ways I learn best is to teach
- I am passionate about several different areas of technology including Automation, Security and cloud

When I am not working, what do I enjoy

 - Beer tasting with my wife. We love going to different breweries and trying what's new
 - Hiking (Beginner and Intermediate routes) - I really just enjoy being outside
 - Retro gaming - playing games on old systems and reliving my youth is the best. I periodically enjoy watching youtubers stream Super Mario World Hacks of levels that would be impossible for me to play.
