My name Nate Bruneau. I am an DevOps/Security/SRE/Software Developer @Microsoft. My posts and opinions are my own and not affiliated with my employer.

- I love to learn and one of the ways I learn best is to teach
- I am passionate about several different areas of technology including Automation, Security and cloud

When I am not working, what do I enjoy

 - Beer tasting with my wife. We love going to different breweries and trying what's new
 - Hiking (Beginner and Intermediate routes) - I really just enjoy being outside
 - Retro gaming - playing games on old systems and reliving my youth is the best. I periodically enjoy watching YouTube video stream Super Mario World Hacks of levels that would be impossible for me to play.
 - Chess - I picked up this hobby in quarantine and have been enjoying it. Definitely a beginner but love to analyze games and get better over time. Chess has a great community and fun to play with others. It can also be infinitely frustrating, but gives you a good lesson in humility ðŸ˜€, which is always a good thing.
